# 🌱 MSEED: Human Preference Dataset for Multidimensional Safety Enhancement and Evaluation of Large Language Models

## 🧩  Overview

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various NLP tasks due to training on massive datasets. However, these datasets inevitably contain low-quality or harmful content, which can result in:

- ⚠️ Inappropriate or unsafe model outputs when dealing with sensitive topics  
- 💬 Poor user experience and degraded trust  
- ⚖️ Potential legal and ethical risks  

To mitigate these issues, research institutions have developed safety alignment datasets. Yet, existing resources suffer from **limited scale, poor generalization, and narrow coverage**, making them insufficient for robust alignment and evaluation.

### ✅ Why MSEED?

**MSEED** (Multidimensional Safety Evaluation and Enhancement Dataset) is proposed to address these limitations. It is designed to:

- 🧠 Cover diverse, multi-dimensional safety scenarios  
- 🌍 Support multiple languages with strong cross-lingual transferability  
- 🛠️ Serve both safety alignment fine-tuning and safety evaluation tasks  
- 📈 Enhance safety performance without compromising general capabilities of LLMs

### 📌 分类标准 Categories

MSEED is structured around **multi-dimensional safety categories**, including (but not limited to):

| Classification Dimension         | Specific Scenarios                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Value Violation   | Inciting Subversion of State Power, Endangering National Security and Interests, Undermining National Unity and Social Stability, Promoting Terrorism and Extremism, Promoting Ethnic Hatred, Promotes Violence and Pornography, Spreading False and Harmful Information, Other Content Prohibited by Law      |
| Content of Discrimination    | Health misinformation, fake news        |
| Business Misconduct     | Personal data leakage, sensitive info   |
| Rights Infringement | Unethical advice, manipulation tactics  |
| Unsafe for Specific Services        | Violate Scientific Common Sense or Mainstream Cognition, Content without Serious Errors but Insufficient to Assist Users |


Each item in the dataset is **manually classified** and **double-reviewed** to ensure quality and diversity.
